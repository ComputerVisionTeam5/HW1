# HW1
Repository for Homework 1.

This repository contains a series of image processing tasks implemented using OpenCV. The tasks are designed to cover a variety of basic to intermediate image manipulation techniques, demonstrating the power and flexibility of OpenCV for computer vision applications. The primary objectives of this repository include capturing images, manipulating color channels, converting color spaces, and understanding image patterns. Each task is accompanied by detailed documentation and example code.

Instructions:
- Capture an Image
- Change the red and green channels
- Convert to Gray Scale
- Invert the Gray Scale (Negative Image)
- Change to HSV and display only the H channel
- Using a line pattern
  - At what distance you start seeing the Moiré patterns
    - Find the digital f of your camera (f_Ax)
      - Find the digital f for the Red, Green and Blue Channels
      - Do you see any differences between the Moiré Patterns?
    - Down Sample the captured image
      - Determine the digital f for the sampled image
      - What is the difference between the original the sampled?
